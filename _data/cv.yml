        - Conducted an independent research project analysing the root causes of fatalities in Indian coal and non-coal mines using historical DGMS fatality reports.
        - Developed a customised text mining pipeline using Python's re and nltk libraries to extract structured data from unstructured PDF reports spanning multiple years.
        - Designed and implemented a relational MySQL database to systematically organise fatality records by mine type, location, cause, and year, facilitating longitudinal analysis.
        - Utilized pandas, matplotlib, and plotly to generate analytical visualisations revealing temporal patterns and critical risk factors contributing to mine accidents.
        - The project provided actionable insights into systemic safety failures and informed recommendations for targeted regulatory interventions.
