<h3>Beyond Research</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify">
Outside academia, I find expression, creativity, and connection through cinema, acting, and directing. Storytelling lets me appreciate different perspectives, delve into human emotions, and explore the magic that resonates across borders and time.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify">
I share these cinematic journeys and my own creative endeavors on my Instagram page <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the.cinema.scipted/" target="_blank"><strong>@the.cinema.scipted</strong></a>, where I celebrate the magic of cinema from my own point of view â€” not reviews, but a reflection of its impact on me.
