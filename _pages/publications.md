<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
My research focuses on understanding how digital platforms shape user behavior, economic incentives, and societal outcomes. I am particularly interested in platform governance, design, reputation mechanisms, and algorithmic fairness. I aim to uncover structural inequities using large-scale data and computational methods to inform the responsible design of digital systems.
