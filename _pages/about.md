Hi! I’m Shivansh, and I’m deeply interested in the multidisciplinary domain of the Digital Economy, where technology, human behaviour, and institutional structures intersect.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> I’m currently working as a <b>Research Associate</b> at the <b>Indian School of Business</b>, with <a href="https://www.isb.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/vasundhara-sharma">Professor Vasundhara Sharma</a>, as part of the <a href="https://www.isb.edu/faculty-and-research/srini-raju-centre-for-it-and-the-networked-economy">SRITNE</a> lab in the Information Systems Department.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Prior Experiences</b>: During the year and a half after earning my degree in Petroleum Engineering, I worked as a Data Scientist at HCLTech, where I developed machine learning solutions for clients such as Chevron and ExxonMobil. My work focused on creating and optimising data ingestion pipelines and building predictive models for asset management and maintenance analytics. This hands-on industry experience deepened my interest in how data-driven technologies impact organisations and people, ultimately leading me to transition into Information Systems and computational social science research. Further details about my skills and experience are available in my <a href="https://gshivansh2001.github.io/cv/">CV</a>.</p>

<h3 >Research Insterests</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;"> I am particularly interested in understanding how technology and digital platforms shape human behaviour, economic incentives, and societal outcomes. I aim to uncover structural biases and social dynamics using large-scale data, to help build more inclusive, transparent, and responsible digital ecosystems.<br> I am fascinated by how digital platforms mediate interactions, shape incentives, and influence both individual behaviour and collective outcomes. As technology becomes more embedded in our everyday decisions—what we read, where we go, whom we trust—understanding these systems is no longer optional; it’s essential. <br> My current research focuses on platform governance, reputation mechanisms, and user reviews—tools that claim to promote trust and transparency, but often conceal deeper social dynamics and structural inequities. These systems are far from neutral, and I strongly believe data-driven research can help surface these hidden patterns and inform better, more inclusive design.<br>Though this is just the initial steps, I would like to start by understanding "what", then ask "why" these patterns emerge and "how" we can help platforms evolve responsibly in the face of shifting user behaviours.</p>

<h3>Personal Interests</h3>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
Outside of research, I enjoy reflecting on technology’s societal impact, writing occasionally in my <a href="https://gshivansh2001.github.io/year-archive/">blog</a>. I’m also interested in literature and cinema. More on this can be found in the <a href="https://gshivansh2001.github.io/teaching/">Beyond Research</a> section of my site.
