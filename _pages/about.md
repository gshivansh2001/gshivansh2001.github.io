<h2>About</h2>

Hi! I'm Shivansh, a Pre-Doctoral Research Associate at the Indian School of Business in the Information Systems group. I work with <a href="https://www.isb.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty-directory/vasundhara-sharma">Professor Vasundhara Sharma</a>, at <a href="https://www.isb.edu/faculty-and-research/srini-raju-centre-for-it-and-the-networked-economy">SRITNE</a> lab in the Information Systems Department. My work broadly lies at the intersection of digital platforms, human behavior, and algorithmic governance.

<p style="text-align: justify;"> <b>Prior Experiences</b>: Before joining ISB, I worked as a Data Scientist at HCLTech, developing machine-learning and analytics solutions for Chevron and ExxonMobil.  My work focused on creating and optimising data ingestion pipelines and building predictive models for asset management and maintenance analytics. This hands-on industry experience deepened my interest in how data-driven technologies impact organisations and people, ultimately leading me to transition into Information Systems and computational social science research. I hold a B.Tech in Petroleum Engineering from IIT (ISM) Dhanbad.

<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<p style="text-align: justify;">
I am interested in how digital platforms shape behavior, incentives, and social outcomes. Broadly, I study platform governance, design, reputation systems, and algorithmic bias using large-scale data and computational methods. <br> To learn more about my interests and recent explorations, please visit my <a href="https://gshivansh2001.github.io/publications/">Research</a> page. </p>

<p><b>Looking Ahead:</b> I am exploring PhD opportunities in Information Systems and related fields. Please feel free to reach out!</p>
